Hi! I'm an artist who went back to grad school for a Digital Society degree. Right now the big project on my plate is my dissertation for that degree, (check it out at https://www.the-test-play.co.uk or the similarly named repository on this account) but watch this space for more artsy, civically minded little code projects.
