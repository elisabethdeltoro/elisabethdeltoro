## ✨ Hi! ✨
I'm Elisabeth, an artist and analyst interested in how technology and statistics can improve lives. If you're looking for a one project summary of my interests and abilities you can check out my master's dissertation project at **[the-test-play.co.uk](https://www.the-test-play.co.uk)** or the similarly named **[repository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/the-test-play)** on this account. I'm always looking to join more artsy, civically minded projects.
