## ✨ Hi! ✨
I'm Elisabeth, an artist who went to grad school to refocus on how technology impacts society! Now that I've finished the dissertation for that master's degree, (check it out at **[the-test-play.co.uk](https://www.the-test-play.co.uk)** or the similarly named **[repository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/the-test-play)** on this account) I'm looking forward to more artsy, civically minded projects. My specialties are large data set analytics and visualizations.

### Credentials
 - <b>Master of Science</b> in Digital Society and Social Change from the University of Glasgow</br>
 - <b>Bachelor of Arts</b> in Theater and Performance Studies from the University of Chicago
 - **[Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/responsive-web-design)** from FreeCodeCamp
 - **[Data Visualization Certificate](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/data-visualization)** from FreeCodeCamp
 
 ### Current Projects
  - As a **[Bluebonnet Data](https://github.com/bluebonnet-data)** Fellow, I'm helping progressive political campaigns with data support. One such project used public data to break down primary votes by county for several key races. You can check that out **[here](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/primary-voter-project)**!
  
 ### Recent Projects
  - I just finished helping the **[Code For America Impact Sprint with OpenColumbus](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/cfa-impact-sprints)**! Volunteers (including me) used satelite footage to map Columbus OH's pedestrian paths for accessibility, using GIS like OpenStreetMap and OpenSidewalks. My review of GIS data entry? It scratches the same itch as Tetris but with an actual tangible benefit.
