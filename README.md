## ✨ Hi! ✨
I'm Elisabeth, an artist who went back to grad school to refocus on how technology impacts society! Now that I've finished the dissertation for that master's degree, (check it out at **[the-test-play.co.uk](https://www.the-test-play.co.uk)** or the similarly named **[repository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/the-test-play)** on this account) I'm looking forward to more artsy, civically minded projects. 

### Credentials
 - <b>Master of Science</b> in Digital Society and Social Change from the University of Glasgow</br>

#### Non-Credentialled Recent Learning
 - **[Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, by Caroline Criado Pérez](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/681ebf7e-7c19-41ad-8b07-eac511dcce8b)** (finished 10/05/22)

 ### Current Projects
  - I'm working on the **[Code For America Impact Sprint with OpenColumbus](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/cfa-impact-sprints)**. Volunteers (including me!) are mapping Columbus OH for accessibility, using GIS like OpenStreetMap and OpenSidewalks. It scratches the same itch as Tetris but with an actual tangible benefit.
  - As a **[Bluebonnet Data](https://github.com/bluebonnet-data)** Fellow, I'm helping a political campaign solicit late-cycle donors by comparing various data sets in Python. (I'm not trying to play coy about the details, but it's a campaign, discretion is discretion, etc).
