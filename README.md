## ✨ Hi! ✨
I'm Elisabeth, an artist and analyst interested in how technology and statistics can improve lives. I've just wrapped up a master's degree (check my dissertation project out at **[the-test-play.co.uk](https://www.the-test-play.co.uk)** or the similarly named **[repository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/the-test-play)** on this account). Now, I'm looking forward to more artsy, civically minded projects. My specialties are large data set analytics and visualizations.

### Credentials
 - <b>Master of Science</b> in Digital Society and Social Change from the University of Glasgow</br>
 - <b>Bachelor of Arts</b> in Theater and Performance Studies from the University of Chicago
 - **[Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/responsive-web-design)** from FreeCodeCamp
 - **[Data Visualization Certificate](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/data-visualization)** from FreeCodeCamp
 
 ### Current Projects
 - I've just wrapped some end-of-year web analytics packets for various international charities with the United Nations Volunteers! These are less show-off-my-code projects and more make-numbers-into-actionable-information-for-overworked-non-profit-employees projects, so they're showcased in my **[Code-free Project Respository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/code-free-projects)**. 
 - On a more artistic note, I'm trying to figure out the difference between digital interactive theater and a video game. I'm thinking the key is a closer examination of site-specific theater (pun)... Stay tuned for updates!
  
 ### Recent Projects
  - As a **[Bluebonnet Data](https://github.com/bluebonnet-data)** Fellow, I got to help out progressive political campaigns with data support. One such project used public data to break down primary votes by county for several key races. You can check that out **[here](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/primary-voter-project)**!
- I recently finished assisting the **[Code For America Impact Sprint with OpenColumbus](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/cfa-impact-sprints)**! Volunteers (including me) used satelite footage to map Columbus OH's pedestrian paths for accessibility, using GIS like OpenStreetMap and OpenSidewalks.
