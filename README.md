## ✨ Hi! ✨
I'm Elisabeth, an artist and analyst interested in how technology and statistics can improve lives. If you're looking for a one project summary of my interests and abilities you can check out my master's dissertation project at **[the-test-play.netlify.app/](https://the-test-play.netlify.app/)** or the similarly named **[repository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/the-test-play)** on this account. Feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabeth-del-toro/)**! I'm always looking to join more artsy or civically-minded projects.

I like to use what is public here on github as my data portfolio. However, as often happens when one moves from learning data analytics to working in data analytics, a lot of the best showcases of my skills are using proprietary data. If there's something you'd like to see, let me know! 

### Credentials
 - <b>Master of Science</b> in Digital Society and Social Change from the University of Glasgow</br>
 - <b>Bachelor of Arts</b> in Theater and Performance Studies from the University of Chicago
 - **[Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/responsive-web-design)** from FreeCodeCamp
 - **[Data Visualization Certificate](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/elisabethsusername/data-visualization)** from FreeCodeCamp
 
 ### Current Projects
 - I work as the Product and Analytics Manager at  **[Project Pulso](https://projectpulso.org/)**! I've learned so much about social media data and qualitative analysis since joining the team early 2023. I look forward to learning even more as we expand into new data streams for our GOTV campaign this year!
 - Like everyone else with an eye towards longevity, I'm trying to get a better grasp on machine learning. And not in a "how do I get chat gpt to write my emails for me" kind of way. Stay tuned for some new certs on the horizon!
 
 ### Previous Projects
  - As a **[Bluebonnet Data](https://github.com/bluebonnet-data)** Fellow, I got to help out progressive political campaigns with data support. One such project used public data to break down primary votes by county for several key races. You can check that out **[here](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/primary-voter-project)**!
  - I wrapped some end-of-year web analytics packets for various international charities with the United Nations Volunteers! These are less show-off-my-code projects and more make-numbers-into-actionable-information-for-overworked-non-profit-employees projects, so they're showcased in my **[Code-free Project Respository](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/code-free-projects)**.
- I assisted the **[Code For America Impact Sprint with OpenColumbus](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/cfa-impact-sprints)**! Volunteers (including me) used satelite footage to map Columbus OH's pedestrian paths for accessibility, using GIS like OpenStreetMap and OpenSidewalks.
